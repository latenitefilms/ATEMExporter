# Supported Hardware

**ATEM Exporter** was built in a few hours during a live music event, and was originally only physically tested in a real-world live production using an **ATEM Constellation 8K** and Blackmagic HyperDeck's and AJA recorders for ISOs.

Whilst, in THEORY every Blackmagic ATEM device should work - there might be things we haven't considered.

The below table keeps track of devices that have been confirmed to work:
