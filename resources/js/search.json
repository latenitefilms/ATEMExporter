[[],[{"l":"ATEM Exporter","p":["ATEM Exporter is a native Swift + Swift UI Mac Application that listens to a Blackmagic ATEM switcher, and logs all the camera changes.","ATEM Exporter is currently in beta(via Apple's TestFlight), and was built in a few hours during a live event, and has only been tested in a real-world live production using an ATEM Constellation, Blackmagic HyperDeck's and AJA recorders for ISOs.","We're currently just using a placeholder icon (from Timecode Toolbox) whilst a new one is being designed - stay tuned!","You can export the camera changes as a Final Cut Pro FCPXML, to use in Final Cut Pro or Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve.","Click here to buy on the Mac App Store","You can export a Program Cut, which allows you to use your program feed from an external recorder (such as a Blackmagic HyperDeck), and add cut points each time there's a camera change.","You can also export a Multicam, which allows you to use your program feed as well as any ISO (i.e. independent camera) recordings, and export a Multicam clip for Final Cut Pro or DaVinci Resolve."]}],[{"l":"Buy on Mac App Store","p":["ATEM Exporter is a one-time payment of USD$150 on the Mac App Store.","Click here to buy on the Mac App Store","You can find information about Educational Pricing here."]},{"l":"Beta Testing","p":["ATEM Exporter is currently being beta tested on Apple's TestFlight."]}],[{"l":"Educational Pricing","p":["Educational institutions can get a 50% discount when they purchase 20 or more copies through Apple School Manager.","Please contact Apple if you need help with Educational Pricing."]}],[{"l":"System Requirements","p":["ATEM Exporter requires macOS 12.4 or later."]}],[{"l":"How To Use","p":["Simply launch ATEM Exporter and put the IP Address of your ATEM in:","You should now be able to connect to the ATEM over Ethernet.","Once connected, it will start logging the camera changes, and you should see the results instantly in the interface:","To export, first stop the connection, then select an Export option, which generates a FCPXML for Final Cut Pro or DaVinci Resolve.","You can't export the data whilst still in record mode, so you need to stop before the Export option is clickable."]},{"l":"Export Program Cut","p":["When exporting a Program Cut, it allows you to select your Program feed (i.e. a ProRes from a HyperDeck), and it will export a FCPXML with a single file in the timeline, with cut points at every camera change.","We found that we needed to delay the ATEM camera changes by 1 frame, although SOMETIMES on SOME cameras, it was still off by a frame. I'm not currently sure if this is a limitation of the ATEM API, or if it's a bug somewhere in my code."]},{"l":"Export Multicam","p":["When exporting a Multicam, it allows you to select your Program feed (i.e. a ProRes from a HyperDeck), as well as any camera ISOs.","If you don't have a Camera ISO, it will default to the Program Feed - but you need at least the Program feed and a single ISO to be able to export.","Again, we found that we needed to delay the ATEM camera changes by 1 frame, although SOMETIMES on SOME cameras, it was still off by a frame. I'm not currently sure if this is a limitation of the ATEM API, or if it's a bug somewhere in my code."]},{"l":"Demo Data","p":["For those that don't have access to an ATEM (like myself), there's also a Populate with Demo Data button that fills the table with real-world data from an actual live event:","You could then create your own dummy media (i.e. something that starts at 20:54:50:00 at 50fps) to test out the FCPXML exports."]},{"l":"Supported Hardware","p":["ATEM 1 M/E Advanced Panel 10","ATEM 1 M/E Advanced Panel 20","ATEM 1 M/E Advanced Panel 30","ATEM 1 M/E Constellation 4K","ATEM 1 M/E Constellation HD","ATEM 2 M/E Advanced Panel 20","ATEM 2 M/E Advanced Panel 30","ATEM 2 M/E Advanced Panel 40","ATEM 2 M/E Constellation 4K","ATEM 2 M/E Constellation HD","ATEM 4 M/E Advanced Panel 40","ATEM 4 M/E Constellation 4K","ATEM 4 M/E Constellation 4K Plus","ATEM 4 M/E Constellation HD","ATEM Camera Control Panel","ATEM Constellation 8K","ATEM Exporter was built in a few hours during a live event, and has only been physically tested in a real-world live production using an ATEM Constellation, Blackmagic HyperDeck's and AJA recorders for ISOs - so if you use a different variety of ATEM, it may or may not work currently.","ATEM Micro Camera Panel","ATEM Micro Panel","ATEM Mini Extreme","ATEM Mini Extreme ISO G2","ATEM Mini Pro","ATEM Mini Pro ISO","ATEM SDI","ATEM SDI Pro ISO","ATEM Streaming Bridge","ATEM Television Studio 4K8","ATEM Television Studio HD8","ATEM Television Studio HD8 ISO","However, only the following devices have been actually confirmed to work:","In THEORY though, the following devices are supported:"]}],[{"l":"Support","p":["If you run into any bugs, crashes, or you have a feature request, you can post an issue here.","If you have any general questions or feedback, you can discuss here.","GitHub registration is free, and this GitHub repository is actively monitored by LateNite Films.","You can also email us: support@latenitefilms.com","We're based in Melbourne, Australia- you can check the timezone here."]}],[{"l":"Release Notes"},{"i":"100-1","l":"1.0.0 (1)","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released 26th May 2025","This is the first release of News Import.
